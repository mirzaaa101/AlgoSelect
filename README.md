# AlgoSelect

## Overview
AlgoSelect is a comprehensive repository dedicated to identifying the most suitable machine learning and deep learning algorithms for specific datasets. It offers a range of preprocessing techniques and a variety of models, facilitating efficient algorithm selection and comparison.

## Features
- **Preprocessing Techniques:** AlgoSelect incorporates preprocessing methods such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Near Miss, and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method (ADASYN) to address class imbalance and enhance data quality.
- **Machine Learning Models:** The repository provides implementations of popular ML algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Deep Learning Models:** AlgoSelect includes advanced DL models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM).
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available, including usage guidelines, code examples, and performance metrics to facilitate seamless integration into existing workflows.

## Repository Information

This repository features a project commissioned by a client on Upwork, serving as coursework for the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/). I have obtained explicit consent from the client to showcase this work in my GitHub portfolio.
